The Walrus is shot. The Greatest is no more.<\/p>\n<p>Elvis Presley, John Lennon, and Muhammad Ali. These three icons changed not only the worlds of music, film, and sports, but the world itself. Their faces were known everywhere, in every nation, across every culture. And their stories became larger than life\u2015until their lives spun out of control at the hands of those they most trusted.<\/p>\n<p>In Killing the Legends, Bill O\u2019Reilly and Martin Dugard explore the lives, legacies, and tragic deaths of three of the most famous people of the 20th century. Each experienced immense success, then failures that forced them to change; each faced the challenge of growing old in fields that privilege youth; and finally, each became isolated, cocooned by wealth but vulnerable to the demands of those in their innermost circles. <\/p>\n<p>Dramatic, insightful, and immensely entertaining, Killing the Legends is the twelfth book in O\u2019Reilly and Dugard\u2019s Killing series: the most popular series of narrative history books in the world, with more than 18 million copies in print.<\/p>\n<p> Publisher                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 St. Martin&#8217;s Press (September 27, 2022) <br \/> Language                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 English <br \/> Hardcover                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 304 pages <br \/> ISBN-10                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 1250283302 <br \/> ISBN-13                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 978-1250283306 <br \/> Item Weight                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 1 pounds <br \/> Dimensions                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 6.6 x 1.35 x 9.75 inches  <\/p>\n<p>4.5<br \/>\nPrice: <span style=\"color:#b12704\">$14.99<\/span><br \/><i><small>(as of Nov 29,2022 02:07:36 UTC &#8211; <span class=\"wp_automatic_amazon_disclaimer\" title=\"Product prices and availability are accurate as of the date\/time indicated and are subject to change.
