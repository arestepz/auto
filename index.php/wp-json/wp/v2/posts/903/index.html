It takes place four months after the events of Alex Verus #12, Risen.<\/p>\n<p>Daniel is an adept who uses his magical talents to make a living as a small-time thief. When he and his friends are hired by a mysterious mage to steal a ring from a cabin in the Romanian woods, it seems like easy money. But all is not as it seems, and Daniel will quickly learn that nobody involved with this theft is exactly who they claim to be. As the members of the group start to turn on one another, Daniel and his friends must discover the truth behind what they\u2019ve found, before it\u2019s too late. Because this forest isn\u2019t empty . . . and their actions have disturbed something that would have been better left alone.<\/p>\n<p> ASIN                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 B0BJGW8X9Z <br \/> Publication date                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 October 31, 2022 <br \/> Language                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 English <br \/> File size                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 407 KB <br \/> Simultaneous device usage                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Unlimited <br \/> Text-to-Speech                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Enabled <br \/> Enhanced typesetting                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Enabled <br \/> X-Ray                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Not Enabled <br \/> Word Wise                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Enabled <br \/> Sticky notes                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 On Kindle Scribe <br \/> Print length                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 123 pages  <\/p>\n<p>4.5<br \/>\nPrice: <span style=\"color:#b12704\">$3.99<\/span><br \/><i><small>(as of Nov 28,2022 23:25:03 UTC &#8211; <span class=\"wp_automatic_amazon_disclaimer\" title=\"Product prices and availability are accurate as of the date\/time indicated and are subject to change.
