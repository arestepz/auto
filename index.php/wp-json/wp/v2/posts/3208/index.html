He won gold medals in the decathlon and pentathlon at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, was an All-American football player at the Carlisle Indian School, the star of the first class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and played major league baseball for John McGraw\u2019s New York Giants. Even in a golden age of sports celebrities, he was one of a kind.<\/p>\n<p>But despite his colossal skills, Thorpe\u2019s life was a struggle against the odds. As a member of the Sac and Fox Nation, he encountered duplicitous authorities who turned away from him when their reputations were at risk. At Carlisle, he dealt with the racist assimilationist philosophy \u201cKill the Indian, Save the Man.\u201d His gold medals were unfairly rescinded because he had played minor league baseball. His later life was troubled by alcohol, broken marriages, and financial distress. He roamed from state to state and took bit parts in Hollywood, but even the film of his own life failed to improve his fortunes. But for all his travails, Thorpe did not succumb. The man survived, complications and all, and so did the myth.<\/p>\n<p>Path Lit by Lightning is a great American story from a master biographer.     <\/p>\n<p>4.5<br \/>\nPrice: <span style=\"color:#b12704\">$16.99<\/span><br \/><i><small>(as of Nov 30,2022 05:20:23 UTC &#8211; <span class=\"wp_automatic_amazon_disclaimer\" title=\"Product prices and availability are accurate as of the date\/time indicated and are subject to change.
