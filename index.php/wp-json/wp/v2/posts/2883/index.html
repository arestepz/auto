Lewis and his partner, Captain William Clark, made the first map of the trans-Mississippi West, provided invaluable scientific data on the flora and fauna of the Louisiana Purchase territory, and established the American claim to Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.<\/p>\n<p>Ambrose has pieced together previously unknown information about weather, terrain, and medical knowledge at the time to provide a vivid backdrop for the expedition. Lewis is supported by a rich variety of colorful characters, first of all Jefferson himself, whose interest in exploring and acquiring the American West went back thirty years. Next comes Clark, a rugged frontiersman whose love for Lewis matched Jefferson\u2019s. There are numerous Indian chiefs, and Sacagawea, the Indian girl who accompanied the expedition, along with the French-Indian hunter Drouillard, the great naturalists of Philadelphia, the French and Spanish fur traders of St. Louis, John Quincy Adams, and many more leading political, scientific, and military figures of the turn of the century.<\/p>\n<p>High adventure, high politics, suspense, drama, and diplomacy combine with high romance and personal tragedy to make this outstanding work of scholarship as readable as a novel.    <\/p>\n<p> ASIN                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 B00AK78P8W <br \/> Publisher                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Simon &#038; Schuster; 1st edition (April 23, 2013) <br \/> Publication date                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 April 23, 2013 <br \/> Language                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 English <br \/> File size                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 12959 KB <br \/> Text-to-Speech                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Enabled <br \/> Screen Reader                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Supported <br \/> Enhanced typesetting                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Enabled <br \/> X-Ray                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Enabled <br \/> Word Wise                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Enabled <br \/> Sticky notes                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 On Kindle Scribe <br \/> Print length                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 538 pages  <\/p>\n<p>4.5<br \/>\nPrice: <span style=\"color:#b12704\">$15.99<\/span><br \/><i><small>(as of Nov 30,2022 05:07:29 UTC &#8211; <span class=\"wp_automatic_amazon_disclaimer\" title=\"Product prices and availability are accurate as of the date\/time indicated and are subject to change.
