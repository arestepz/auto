Spanning styles and genres, principles and tenets, collectively these essays and their accompanying images represent a comprehensive education for the reader, giving him or her the benefit of expert design advice and philosophy, from practical considerations such as seedlings and pathways to stylistic concerns such as asymmetry and rhythm. Each essay is paired with photographs of the designer&#8217;s work that illustrate the principles being discussed, adding a powerful visual component to the book.<\/p>\n<p>Unique in the quality of its contributors, this book will be a landmark publication in the field, helpful and inspirational for the amateur gardener, as well as students of garden design and garden design professionals.    <\/p>\n<p> Publisher                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Rizzoli; Illustrated edition (April 14, 2020) <br \/> Language                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 English <br \/> Hardcover                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 288 pages <br \/> ISBN-10                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 0847866661 <br \/> ISBN-13                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 978-0847866663 <br \/> Item Weight                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 4.1 pounds <br \/> Dimensions                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 9.34 x 1.22 x 11.3 inches  <\/p>\n<p>4.5<br \/>\nPrice: <span style=\"color:#b12704\">$32.99<\/span><br \/><i><small>(as of Nov 28,2022 07:36:25 UTC &#8211; <span class=\"wp_automatic_amazon_disclaimer\" title=\"Product prices and availability are accurate as of the date\/time indicated and are subject to change.
