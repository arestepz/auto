When an uninvited and unwelcome family suddenly arrives to join their relatives for a summer of relaxation, the results are anything but restful. Chet Ripley&#8217;s (Candy) plans for a quiet vacation at a lakeside resort quickly take a turn when his obnoxious brother-in-law, Roman Craig (Aykroyd), and his snooty family appear unannounced and ready to join for a season of &#8220;fun&#8221; in the sun. Unfortunately, the only thing these two in-laws have in common is their intense dislike for each other. Soon, it&#8217;s brother-in-law against brother-in-law in an uproarious and hilarious fight to the finish!<\/span><span><br \/>Bonus Content:<br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"a-unordered-list a-vertical\">\n<li><span class=\"a-list-item\"><span>Theatrical Trailer<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>]]><\/span><br \/> Aspect Ratio                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 1.85:1 <br \/> MPAA rating                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) <br \/> Product Dimensions                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.33 Ounces <br \/> Audio Description:                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 English <br \/> Item model number                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 61119605 <br \/> Director                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Howard Deutch <br \/> Media Format                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 NTSC, Subtitled <br \/> Run time                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 1 hour and 31 minutes <br \/> Release date                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 August 16, 2016 <br \/> Actors                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Annette Bening, Chris Young, Stephanie Faracy <br \/> Subtitles:                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 French <br \/> Producers                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Arne Schmidt, John Hughes <br \/> Language                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 English (DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0) <br \/> Studio                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 Universal Pictures Home Entertainment <br \/> ASIN                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 B01G8RTRCA <br \/> Writers                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 John Hughes <br \/> Country of Origin                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 USA <br \/> Number of discs                                    \u200f                                        :                                    \u200e                                 1  <\/p>\n<p>5<br \/>\nPrice: <span style=\"color:#b12704\"><del>$14.98<\/del> - $9.99<\/span><br \/><i><small>(as of Nov 29,2022 10:44:35 UTC &#8211; <span class=\"wp_automatic_amazon_disclaimer\" title=\"Product prices and availability are accurate as of the date\/time indicated and are subject to change.
