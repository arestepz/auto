<p>&#8220;It began as a mistake.&#8221; By middle age, Henry Chinaski has lost more than twelve years of his life to the U.S. Postal Service. In a world where his three true, bitter pleasures are women, booze, and racetrack betting, he somehow drags his hangover out of bed every dawn to lug waterlogged mailbags up mud-soaked mountains, outsmart vicious guard dogs, and pray to survive the day-to-day trials of sadistic bosses and certifiable coworkers. This classic 1971 novel—the one that catapulted its author to national fame—is the perfect introduction to the grimly hysterical world of legendary writer, poet, and Dirty Old Man Charles Bukowski and his fictional alter ego, Chinaski.</p>

   This is the story of Rachel, a young girl who needs to die.</p>
<p>Rachel is so sick and in constant pain. All medical help tried and failed, so she decides to take her own life&#8211;legally.</p>
<p>But under the law, she isn&#8217;t old enough to get doctor-assisted end of life measures.</p>
<p>Rachel needs a lawyer to get the right medical care. Enter Attorney Thaddeus Murfee, who takes up her case and starts doing what lawyers do. Her family and Thaddeus travel from California to Oregon, where the laws are friendlier. There, they set up housekeeping in a campground. Their group includes a young male nurse named Johann. He falls in love with Rachel&#8211;but Johann has a deadly past. The court trials begin, a race to die&#8230;the right way.</p>
