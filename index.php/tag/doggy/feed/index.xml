  <span class="a-text-bold">HEAVY-DUTY BAGS DESIGNED WITH MOTHER NATURE IN MIND</span><span></p>
<p></span><span class="a-text-bold">Looking for heavy-duty dog poop bags that don’t easily break?</span><span></p>
<p></span><span class="a-text-bold">Smarter waste bags that you can confidently toss in the trash?</span><span></p>
<p></span><span class="a-text-bold">Then you’ll love our new and improved doggy bags!</span><span></p>
<p>We went back to the drawing board and created extra-strong leak-proof bags made using a <br />special ingredient. The secret behind this smart technology? A certified additive known as d2w. <br />It shortens the life of our bags at the end of its useful life when it ends up in the open <br />environment.</p>
<p></span><span class="a-text-bold">So you get to throw your pet’s waste without destroying the environment.</span><span></p>
<p></span><span class="a-text-bold">Here are more reasons you’ll love these strong poop bags:</span><span></p>
<p></span></p>
<ul class="a-unordered-list a-vertical">
<li><span class="a-list-item"><span>&#8211; Made with 15 microns-thick plastic for greater strength.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"><span>&#8211; Well-sealed seams prevent the bags from ripping.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>&#8211; The opaque design masks the contents of the bags.- Scented with a jasmine fragrance that keeps odor at bay.- Very easy to separate from the roll thanks to high-quality perforations.- Sized at 13” (L) x 9” (H) to handle poop from all breeds.- They leave you enough room at the top to create a knot.- Backed by a 100. </p>
<p></span><span class="a-text-bold">Go ahead, get heavy-duty biodegradable poop bags that you can toss guilt-free!</span>  <br /> Product Dimensions                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 16.14 x 1.57 x 0.5 inches; 11.99 Ounces <br /> Item model number                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 MX-150B <br /> Date First Available                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 August 7, 2019 <br /> Manufacturer                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 Best Pet Supplies, Inc. <br /> ASIN                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 B07W4M599X <br /> Country of Origin                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 China </p>
<p>MAKING PLASTIC SMARTER: Unlike other pet waste bags that harm the environment, ours lasts much shorter time if it gets into the open environment due to presence of d2w additive.<br />MASK THE MESS: No more cringing in disgust. Opaque, scented, and beautifully designed, these doggie bags for poop make picking up after your four-legged pal less of a nightmare.<br />EASY TO SEPARATE AND OPEN: High-quality perforations make separating the biodegradable poop bags a breeze. So you get to clear the mess much faster.<br />SIZED JUST RIGHT: Measuring 13” (L) x 9” (H), the pet poop bags are large enough to handle the largest of deposits.
