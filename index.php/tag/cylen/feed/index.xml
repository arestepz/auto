 <br />Short Plush<br />GEL ENHANCED SEAT CUSHION &#8211; If you want premium high-density memory foam plus gel, our pick is the Gel Enhanced Seat Cushion. The memory foam is durable, comfortable, and long-lasting while the gel prevents the cushion from feeling too hot. A soft, machine-washable short plush cover makes it easy to keep clean. Non-slip rubber dots on the bottom means it won&#8217;t slide out of your chair as you shift around<br />QUITE PORTABLE CHAIR CUSHION &#8211; The carrying handle makes it easy to move from seat to seat and it&#8217;s perfectly sized for a work chair or use in a wheelchair. Great for office, home, travel, car seat or wheelchair use. You can even use it outdoors, but the cover isn&#8217;t waterproof, so save it for dry weather<br />ERGONOMIC &#8220;U&#8221; SHAPED CUTOUT DESIGN &#8211; Whether you&#8217;re working from home, sitting in an office chair, a car or truck, or any kind of seat at all, the U-shaped cutout for your tailbone is specifically designed to maximize comfort and support while reducing pressure on your tailbone. The CYLEN office chair cushion can make your day more enjoyable and keep away those aches and pains<br />IT’S A COMMON BYPRODUCT OF FATIGUE &#8211; You might slouch or begin leaning forward at an uncomfortable angle at your desk, and you might not even register the discomfort right away because your mind is intently elsewhere. This comfort seat cushion features ergonomic design to help soothe already-existing aches and pains that came about after months or even years of slouching and leaning<br />TIPS &#8211; Since it’s made of high-density memory foam, keep in mind that the firmness of the cushion can be affected by temperature fluctuations. Especially in cold weather, many users mention removing the cushion from the car; otherwise, it can become firm and hard and won’t return to its soft, supportive state until the material warms up again </p>
