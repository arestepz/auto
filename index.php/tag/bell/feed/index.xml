<h3 class="a-spacing-mini"> DOG BELLS ARE THE PEFECT SOLUTION TO TOILET TRAIN YOUR LOVELY PET. HERE ARE 4 SIMPLE STMPLE AND EFFECTIVE STEPS TO TRAIN YOUR DOG TO USE DOORBELL.  </h3>
<p class="a-spacing-base"> <span class="a-text-bold">STEPS 1.</span> Introduce the bell to the dog. Let them feel it by sniffing it. let them hear the sound of the bell. Encourage its interest by giving her treats and show your appreciation that it knows you use only when she does good job (like good girl, my man.. good job etc.) </p>
<p class="a-spacing-base"> <span class="a-text-bold">STEPS 2.</span> Second stage is to get your dog to ring the bell. For this you can take the bell outside and show your how to ring the bell. You can use family environment she is comfortable with. Every time it rings the bell give her treat.  Few dogs do better with lot of attention they get some get distracted. So please chose the set up based on your dog’s nature. </p>
<p class="a-spacing-base"> <span class="a-text-bold">STEPS 3.</span> Now place the bell where you intend to place it. Like hanging it to your backside door where you normally let the dog out. Ensure bell is firmly attached so that it doesn’t fall out by a simple tug/pull which might scare them. Again positively reinforce your appreciation with treat and words when they ring, do open the door and give her a treat when it goes out the door. </p>
<p class="a-spacing-base"> <span class="a-text-bold">STEPS 4.</span> It it is time make it a habit. If you used to let your dog go outside once you are up to let it potty/pee, use the same setup but this time make your dog ring the bell. Reward once it rings the bell and steps outside. Keep repeating this process until it becomes natural for the dog to ringing the bell is the natural way to ask to be let out. </p>
<p class="a-spacing-base"> <span class="a-text-bold">Other tips：</span> </p>
<p class="a-spacing-base"> Do this before your dog has breakfast so he is more food motivated.We strongly recommend patience and continuous positive reinforcement throughout. Dogs that love outdoors may take to the training faster. Consistency also plays a key role during initial days like, not letting your dog follow you outside without ringing the bell or giving treats when it doesn’t complete its part of the bargain. </p>
