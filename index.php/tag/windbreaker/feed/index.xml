  <span>Here&#8217;s a gotta-have pullover jacket that has endless uses in your weekend wardrobe. This lightweight, effortless windbreaker from Champion is perfect to toss in your weekend tote, to keep in your golf bag, or with your workout gear. Wind-and water-resistant, this ultra-light style pulls over your head with a half zipper and features a handy scuba-style neckline and hood with bungee cord closure. Better yet, it folds right up into its own front zip pocket, creating a neat little pouch that fits anywhere, even a briefcase. This packable jacket can be easily layered over a sweatshirt or sweater. And it&#8217;s detailed with elasticized cuffs to keep out wind and rain, plus a bungee-cord hem to adjust as you choose. And maybe the best thing about it is that it&#8217;s made of 100% recycled polyester so you can feel good about wearing it. When you wear this packable windbreaker jacket, you&#8217;ll proudly display the Champion logo on the chest and the iconic &#8220;C&#8221; logo appliquéd at the left cuff.</span>  <br /> Product Dimensions                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 22 x 18 x 1 inches; 8.68 Ounces <br /> Item model number                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 V1012 <br /> Date First Available                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 November 15, 2018 <br /> Manufacturer                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 Champion <br /> ASIN                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 B078GPYT9H </p>
