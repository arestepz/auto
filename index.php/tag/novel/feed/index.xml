<p>Being the VP of the Ruthless Kings has made me jaded and scarred, a savage bloodthirsty beast. </p>
</p>
<p>Grit, pain, blood, the three constants in my life.</p>
<p> Love?</p>
<p> I wouldn&#8217;t burden anyone with loving me. I&#8217;m a hard man to love.</p>
<p>Until she walks through the garage doors, looking perfect in her little blue dress and high heels.</p>
<p> She&#8217;s neat and clean and too damn good for me, but I&#8217;m determined to get her filthy.</p>
<p>Then Reaper reminds me of the debt I owe him, and the fine is costly—stay away from the woman whose voice is a song.</p>
<p> Because her father is the sheriff of Vegas, and he fucking hates us.</p>
<p>Come to find out, the sheriff is a bit crooked, which unlocks a whole new set of rules in my playbook. And I have the right tools to break all of them.</p>
<p>Do I go against my Prez again for my little sparrow? Or do I let her fly away?</p>

<p>&#8220;It began as a mistake.&#8221; By middle age, Henry Chinaski has lost more than twelve years of his life to the U.S. Postal Service. In a world where his three true, bitter pleasures are women, booze, and racetrack betting, he somehow drags his hangover out of bed every dawn to lug waterlogged mailbags up mud-soaked mountains, outsmart vicious guard dogs, and pray to survive the day-to-day trials of sadistic bosses and certifiable coworkers. This classic 1971 novel—the one that catapulted its author to national fame—is the perfect introduction to the grimly hysterical world of legendary writer, poet, and Dirty Old Man Charles Bukowski and his fictional alter ego, Chinaski.</p>
