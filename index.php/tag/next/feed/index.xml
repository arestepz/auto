These start out as a classic button, zip fly, 2 front pocket, 2 rear zip pocket, 1 cargo short, but that where normal stops. This classic 10.5&#8243; short is super-comfortable and has a ton of tech and performance built in them. Huk uses a lightweight, quick dry, UPF +30 stretch fabric gusseted crotch to keep your mobility at a premium. Rear yoke includes laser perforation to further enhance the quick dry / breathability of these shorts. Lastly, Huk added an adjustable waistband for a perfect fit. On the boat, dock or just hanging around town, these will make your day a little better and always have you at the ready to fish. At Huk, we unite all anglers through performance-engineered, technical gear designed to fuel your passion and pursuit no matter when, where or how you fish.</span>  <br /> Is Discontinued By Manufacturer                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 No <br /> Product Dimensions                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 8 x 8 x 2 inches; 8 Ounces <br /> Item model number                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 H2000011 <br /> Date First Available                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 August 24, 2018 <br /> Manufacturer                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 Huk <br /> ASIN                                    ‏                                        :                                    ‎                                 B07GSYZY98 </p>
