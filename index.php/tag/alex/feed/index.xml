<p>A novella set in the Alex Verus universe. It takes place four months after the events of Alex Verus #12, Risen.</p>
<p>Daniel is an adept who uses his magical talents to make a living as a small-time thief. When he and his friends are hired by a mysterious mage to steal a ring from a cabin in the Romanian woods, it seems like easy money. But all is not as it seems, and Daniel will quickly learn that nobody involved with this theft is exactly who they claim to be. As the members of the group start to turn on one another, Daniel and his friends must discover the truth behind what they’ve found, before it’s too late. Because this forest isn’t empty . . . and their actions have disturbed something that would have been better left alone.</p>
