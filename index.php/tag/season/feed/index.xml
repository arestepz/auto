  <span></span><span>Big changes are in store for Scranton in the hilarious eighth season of this Primetime Emmy® Award-winning series. Andy takes over as manager of Dunder Mifflin and finds the job to be more than he bargained for. He wants to win the respect of his employees, while going toe-to-toe with Robert California (James Spader, Boston Legal), the enigmatic new CEO, who wants to turn the office into his personal playground.Dwight makes his own grab for power when he leads a team to Florida to work under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate, Dr. Who), who may be slightly out of her mind. Jim and Pam&#8217;s relationship is put to the test when Pam goes on maternity leave and her replacement has eyes for Jim. Meanwhile, Erin harbors lingering feelings for Andy; Angela&#8217;s relationship deepens with her dashing (State) Senator; and Darryl looks for love in the warehouse. </p>
