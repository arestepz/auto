These start out as a classic button, zip fly, 2 front pocket, 2 rear zip pocket, 1 cargo short, but that where normal stops. This classic 10.5&#8243; short is super-comfortable and has a ton of tech and performance built in them. Huk uses a lightweight, quick dry, UPF +30 stretch fabric gusseted crotch to keep your mobility at a premium. Rear yoke includes laser perforation to further enhance the quick dry / breathability of these shorts. Lastly, Huk added an adjustable waistband for a perfect fit. On the boat, dock or just hanging around town, these will make your day a little better and always have you at the ready to fish.
