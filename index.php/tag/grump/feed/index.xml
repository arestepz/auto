<p>Wall Street Journal best-selling author Nicole Snow returns with a fierce and hilarious office romance where two sworn enemies make undeniable lovers.</p>
<p>My “interview” with bosshole supreme was anything but normal. <br /> He picked the worst day ever to chase me off my favorite park bench. <br /> I retaliated with a spray of cinnamon latte all over his Italian shoes. <br /> Then &#8211; for some unholy reason &#8211; Magnus Heron offered me a job.</p>
<p>Even his name sounds like a piece of work. <br /> Guess what? He is. <br /> But when you&#8217;re single, broke, and barely surviving in Chicago, you hop on the gift horse offering a six-figure salary and ride. <br /> I picked the stallion on a one-way trip to hell. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the impossibly long hours working under Grump-zilla. <br /> It&#8217;s not the fact that he&#8217;s snarly, demanding, horribly rich, and chiseled. <br /> It&#8217;s not even the pesky way he makes me blush every flipping time we&#8217;re together. <br /> Mag is my boss. I&#8217;m his lowly assistant. Some rules are carved in stone.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my mantra until we&#8217;re sharing a sunset too beautiful for life. <br /> Alone with wandering lips, whispered secrets, and disaster in the making. <br /> The plan was simple: punch the clock, get paid, and keep hating my boss. <br /> What&#8217;s the blueprint when the office grump brings me to my knees?</p>
<p>Full-length enemies-to-lovers romance with the banter, intrigue, and slow-burn love worthy of a happily ever after. The bossman from Hades meets the hellion he totally can&#8217;t stand &#8211; until he can&#8217;t live without her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.5<br />
